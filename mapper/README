camera-dodge-test.php
-   Contains tests to make sure that camera-dodge.php is functioning properly.




Manual Processes:

Step 1

map-placement.php
-   Use this to assign relative x and y position values to specific maps that you
    wish to merge into one large map.

Step 2: 

set-collision-types.php - requires maps be processed.
-   Uses map images to manage what collision type a tile will be, add grass 
    entities, or set tiles "above player".




!! To be made automated !!

border-change.php
-   Outputs a series of if-statements used by the player to determine if 
    a change in the repeated-background-border layer should be changed.

animations.php
-   Outputs a bunch of JavaScript which is used to define which tiles
    in the master tilesheet are to be animated, and how.




Automated processes:

Step 1:

dump-map-tiles.php  - requires map image be in the maps folder.
-   Rip tiles directly from a source map image into a folder.
    NOTICE: can be time consuming with multiple maps.

Step 2:

merge-maps.php
-   Reads maps which have been assigned relative x and y values, and combines 
    them them together into a larger map.

Step 3:

process-map.php
-   Generates a JSON file for each map, containing map width, height, and tile hashes.
    NOTICE: can be time consuming with large maps (Hoenn takes about 12 min).

Step 4:

merge-map-tiles.php
-   Combines all dumped tiles, and manually editted tiles into a single "master" 
    tilesheet. Generates an image and a JSON file containing hash information.

Step 5:

get-collision-types.php - requires master tilesheet be made.
-   Creates an ImpactJS module file, defining which tiles are "special". 
    (Ie. Which tiles are water, grass, reflective, etc.)

Step 6:

generate-map.php
-   Outputs a Weltmeister map file with all map layers, including a collision map.
