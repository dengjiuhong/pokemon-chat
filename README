This is an experimental game/chat I created entirely in HTML5 and JavaScript
using the ImpactJS framework, with Socket.IO and NodeJS for the network
component, and a little bit of jQuery for the chat input.

The game can currently be played at this URL:

To run the server yourself, you must have NodeJS installed. If server.bat does
not work, you can drag server.js onto node.exe instead (does the same thing).

Change-Log:

To-do:
----------------------------

Camera:
- Ability to restrict certain areas of map from being displayed on screen.

Effects:
- "Ash" grass entity.
- Fix reflection not animating properly when facing 'right'.
- Add brightness or 'fading' effect to reflections.
- "Shallow-water" feet effect.
- "Deep sand" effect.
- Swim "bobbing" animation as well as initial hop.
- Overhead smoke-effect in LAVARIDGE TOWN.
- Weather effects: rain in ROUTE 119, sandstorm in ROUTE 111, ash in ROUTE 113.
- Smashable rocks, and cuttable trees (low priority).
- Sinking logs in PACIFIDLOG TOWN (low priority).

Movement:
- Disable walking outside of known regions.
- A* pathfinding (low priority).

Bicycle:
- Add 'curvy' tire tracks when turning corners in sand.
- Add 'Mach' bicycle which has variable speed (low priority).

Chat system:
- Prevent multiple chat bubbles from one source from existing at the same time.
- Server sends a failure notice upon non-delivery of a private message.
- Chat bubble repositions itself to be on-screen if it is not (low priority).
- Invalid commands are reported to use as such.
- Remove extra pixel between letters in chat-bubbles.

Maps:
- Tree-tip over water just to the right and up from DEWFORD TOWN.

Code:
- Replace 'magic' numbers in weather-controller.generatePos() function with
  actual references to rain-drop and sand-cloud entities.


Known Issues:
----------------------------

- Network players can trigger grass to 'rustle' on other players screens by
  running up to one and stopping just before it.

- Network players will appear to teleport slightly when they stop or change
  directions if their framerate and yours differ significantly.

- Chat system does not support accented characters.

- Currently a player can walk through a door, and keep going without being 
  zoned until they let go of the movement key.
