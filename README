This is an experimental game/chat I created entirely in HTML5 and JavaScript
using the ImpactJS framework, with Socket.IO and NodeJS for the network
component, and a little bit of jQuery for the chat.

To run the server yourself, you must have NodeJS installed. If server.bat does
not work, you can drag server.js onto node.exe instead (does the same thing).


Change-Log:

To-do:
----------------------------

Reflections:
- Add: brightness/fading effect to reflections.
- Fix: Tree-tips over reflective water hide reflection.

Weather:
- Add: Triggered by player walking in certain areas.
- Fix: Sand-screen and ash-screen follow the player as he moves.

Water:
- Fix: Player does 'slow-walk' animation trying to swim against a wall.
- Add: Player shows 'bobbing' animation when swimming.
- Add: Initial hop on to surf-entity animation.
- Add: Water ripple effect.

Grass:
- Fix: Not all grass entities spawned by network players disappear.
- Fix: Grass doesn't despawn if tile is left with a ledge-hop.
- Add: Despawning of persistent-grass entities when off-screen.

Effects:
- Overhead smoke-effect in LAVARIDGE TOWN.
- Smashable rocks, and cuttable trees (low priority).
- Sinking logs in PACIFIDLOG TOWN (low priority).

Server:
- Remembers players position and map.

Bicycle:
- Add: 'curvy' tire tracks when turning corners in sand.
- Add: bike sprites for MAY (girl).
- Fix: network players on bike leave the wrong kind of track in sand.
- Add: 'Mach' bicycle which has variable speed (low priority).

Chat system:
- Name changing using the /name command.
- Prohibit the use of certain characters in names.
- Restrict message length.
- Server sends a failure notice upon non-delivery of a private message.
- Invalid commands are reported to user as such.

Maps:
- Tree-tip over water just to the right and up from DEWFORD TOWN.
- LAVENDER TOWN overhead banner is not overhead.
- Fix: Fence in the 'flower' town is walkable from above.
- Fix: Maintain tops can be walked on to from above.

Movement:
- Reflective water should be swimmable intead of walkable.
- A* pathfinding (low priority).

Optimizations:
- Boost FPS by not drawing repeating border in regions where it will be covered up.
- When processing a merged map, don't process the areas known to be black empty space.
- Integrate animation frames into master tilesheet and drop ID-tiles.

Code Improvements:
- Splash, jump, and deep-sand entities can all likely share a single parent class.
- Add all entities that follow player into player.followers (such as chat bubble, name, etc.)
- Have the initial camera-dodge-factory load entities from a module, not AJAX (low priority).


Known Issues:
----------------------------

- Network players can trigger grass to 'rustle' on other players screens by
  running up to one and stopping just before it.

- Network players will appear to teleport slightly when they stop or change
  directions if their framerate and yours differ significantly.

- Chat system does not support accented characters.

- Player can walk through a door, and keep going without being 
  zoned until they let go of the movement key.

- Minimizing the game and coming back to it after some time will spawn all at 
  once every chat bubble that had been missed.

- Player appears to run faster on sand-tiles than on regular land tiles.

- It is possible to get from a high to a low point or vice versa in some areas,
  such as from below a bridge to being on the bridge, by walking over certain tiles.

- Tall-grass entities appear darker than they should be.
